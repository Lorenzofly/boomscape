-- add better drops to clue scrolls caskets, 2x pc points scroll, 2x slayer points scroll, 2x pvp points scroll, (rare) 2x drop rate scroll, etc

-- leaderboard ui ingame for first to do something, winners 1st 2nd 3rd. rewards can be ig rewards or bonds idk


-- xp modes kinda weird, divided people from realism to easy mode, whats the point? easy moders just win the leaderboard for not trying 

-- special weekly quests for each player! my own idea, make rewards decent for ironmen maybe?


-- special bossing events!!! also my idea. for a time period certain bosses have extra drop rate or something special.


-- pvp event!!! for a hour or so pvp points are double or pvp rewards are cheaper idk

-- slayer event! for a while slayer points double and better drops?

-- i feel like bossing isnt that rewarding, then again i dont boss 24/7 i feel like it should be better somehow. especially since bosses are bugged and just beat the fuck out of me for no reason. ex. zulrah maging when in rangd mode. dem gorillaz rando switch attack mode


-- engaging events really, there is so much content out there, just make events for content like thieving farming fishing, competitions you know. 


--make wildy drops have a special table for tasks or certain mobs. Like a special casket 1/1k 2k 3k 4k idk . a spin casket maybe with good loot, like just good stuff, the adrenaline when getting the casket should be high.


-- this server can be really good, i think we just need to capatilize on what we already have. I recently havent been having fun just doing these slayer tasks. Like i dont get anything then i see these non ironmen get bofas literally for free and get nice pve drops. Demoralizes me and my group iron men. Like idk maybe add better loot to ench crystal chest. I feel like it can be better and not ruin eco.


--add custom areas for new enemies bosses or event zones for the server when something special happens if added.

--add special pvp chest, you can buy the key with points or get as a lucky drop from wildy tasks

-- add special pve chest, you can get a key from bosses or certain enemies. The key can be specific to each boss and drop a high tier item from their drop table. Or just make keys drop from any boss.

-- skilling chest? get key from skilling maybe. Idk what youd get, maybe just a bunch of supplies or a little and make the keys somewhat easy to get.


-- blood money anygood? I remember playing pvp servers that have that but this is eco


-- make a shop where you can spend slayer points on lots of items, like rings!!!! Im tired of doing tasks getting no drops!!!! i have all these slayer points but for what? 
Make a shop to spend slayer points on bis rings or weapons armors. Make the grind worth it!!! like oh im sorry mate you got shit for luck, spend your points for a drop of your choosing! boom my idea. like we have a pvp shop? but its a eco server?!?!? make that pve shop
